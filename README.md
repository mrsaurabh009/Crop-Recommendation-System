Crop Recommendation System
Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers decide the best crops to plant based on various factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and past crop data. This project aims to improve agricultural productivity and efficiency.
Features
- *Data Preprocessing*: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- *Machine Learning Model*: Train a machine learning model to predict the most suitable crops.
- *Interactive Analysis*: Use Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- *Comprehensive Recommendations*: Provide detailed crop recommendations based on input parameters.
